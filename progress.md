Original prompt: Please look through my game and ensure that it is solid from top to bottom. I have been experiencing login issues, and leaderboard sync issues.

- Initialized by agent using develop-web-game skill.
- Next: audit login + leaderboard flow (frontend + API), reproduce issues with Playwright loop, then patch and re-test.

## Update 1: Auth/fallback and leaderboard sync hardening
- Patched `index.html` auth/network logic to avoid cloud sessions silently dropping into local auth mode.
- Added helpers:
  - `isLocalAuthToken(token)`
  - `isNetworkLikeError(error)`
  - `shouldAllowLocalFallback(error)`
  - `apiFetchCloudThenLocal(url, options, fallbackMessage)`
- Updated signup/login to use cloud-first with controlled fallback to local storage only for outage/misconfig classes (network/404/5xx).
- Updated `restoreSession` to avoid deleting a valid cloud token on transient cloud failures.
- Updated score/stat sync:
  - cloud token uses cloud endpoint directly (`apiFetchCloudFirst`) for score submit and stats fetch
  - local token continues to use local API path
- Updated all-time leaderboard fetch to be cloud-first and only fall back when cloud is unavailable.

## Update 2: Validation
- JS parse check passed for `index.html` script block (`new Function` parse smoke test).
- Could not run `develop-web-game` Playwright client yet because `playwright` package is missing and install failed due network DNS error (`EAI_AGAIN` to registry.npmjs.org).
- Ran local server API smoke test on `server.js` (localhost:3000):
  - signup: pass
  - login: pass
  - save score: pass
  - leaderboard fetch: pass
  - me endpoint with bearer token: pass

## Remaining TODOs / next agent
- Re-run web game Playwright loop once network/package install is available:
  - `npm install playwright`
  - `node "$WEB_GAME_CLIENT" --url http://127.0.0.1:5173 --actions-file "$WEB_GAME_ACTIONS" --iterations 3 --pause-ms 250 --screenshot-dir output/web-game`
- Validate UI-side auth/leaderboard flows in-browser for:
  - cloud available
  - cloud temporarily unavailable then restored (ensure session not dropped and leaderboard recovers)

## Update 3: Challenge Tab behavior fix
- Fixed `Tab` handling in `handleTypingKeydown` so active challenges restart the current run instead of abandoning to the challenge menu.
- Updated challenge hint text from "Tab to abandon" to "Tab to restart" for all active challenge variants.
- Re-ran script parse smoke check for `index.html`: pass.

## Update 4: Ghost cursor toggle
- Added a new control button beside `New Quote` and `Restart`: `Ghost Cursor: On/Off`.
- Added persisted preference key: `sampire-ghost-cursor-enabled`.
- Implemented toggle wiring:
  - `loadGhostCursorPreference()`
  - `updateGhostToggleButton()`
  - `toggleGhostCursor()`
- Ghost rendering now respects the toggle in all key paths:
  - initial ghost replay cursor on `init()`
  - per-character ghost classes (`makeCharSpan`, `updateCharSpan`)
  - ghost replay stepping in `startTimer()`
- Toggle state is applied on startup before `newTest()` runs.
- JS parse smoke check passed after edits.
- Attempted Playwright validation after ghost toggle change; still blocked because `playwright` package is unavailable in this environment (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`).

## Update 5: Admin panel profile merge + reset/delete controls
- Fixed admin grant behavior to *add* to existing profile values instead of replacing key fields:
  - `setLevel` now adds equivalent XP (`(level-1)*500`) to existing XP.
  - `setXp` and `setSkillPoints` now add to current XP/SP.
- Added admin account reset capabilities (cloud + local fallback):
  - Reset username (`resetUsername`) with validation + uniqueness checks.
  - Reset password (`resetPassword`) with minimum length checks.
  - Username changes now propagate to saved score rows and leaderboard usernames.
- Added admin account deletion capability (cloud + local fallback):
  - `DELETE /api/admin/users/:id` in cloud worker route + handler.
  - Local fallback supports `DELETE` on same route and removes user/profile/scores.
- Updated admin panel UI:
  - Added fields: `Reset Username`, `Reset Password`.
  - Changed action button to `Apply Changes`.
  - Added `Delete User` button with confirmation.
- If admin changes/deletes the currently logged-in account, UI now refreshes identity (or logs out after delete).

## Update 6: Modal return flow + profile streak status
- Implemented modal stacking so closing sub-menus returns to the previous menu/modal instead of dropping back to the main screen.
  - Added `modalStack` and updated `openModal`/`closeModal` behavior.
  - Works for profile submenus (Account Management, Delete Confirm, Shop, Inventory, Admin), and preserves focus restoration only when the final modal closes.
- Added profile header streak status next to username:
  - Shows `${N}-day streak` always.
  - Shows `· Xx XP boost` only when active multiplier > 1.
  - Uses existing `getStreakData()` and `getXPMultiplier()` logic.
- JS parse smoke check passed.

## Update 7: Top-level login flow refactor
- Removed bottom account login section from main page layout.
- Top right button now routes by auth state:
  - logged in -> `Profile`
  - logged out -> `Login`
- Added new `login-modal` with existing auth fields and CTA text:
  - "Don't have an account? Create one for free to track your scores, level up and unlock rewards!"
- Added modal handlers:
  - `openLoginModal`, `closeLoginModal`, `handleLoginModalBackdrop`, `openProfileOrLogin`
- Updated auth flows:
  - successful login/signup closes login modal
  - Escape now closes login modal
- Kept logout available in profile header actions.
- JS parse smoke check passed.

## Update 8: Auth fallback + leaderboard reliability hardening
- Tightened cloud/local fallback behavior to stop intermittent cloud outages from presenting as local auth failures:
  - `apiFetch` no longer auto-switches the entire session to local mode on network timeout/abort.
  - Added `shouldAllowAuthLocalFallback()` and used it for signup/login so auth only falls back to local on API-route missing (`404`) instead of `5xx`/network issues.
- Improved login flow resilience:
  - Login button is now disabled while request is in-flight to prevent duplicate concurrent submissions/races.
- Leaderboard tab correctness + stale-view fix:
  - `setLbTab()` now always calls `refreshLeaderboard()` so Weekly/All Time don't reuse stale cached rows.
  - Added explicit loading state while leaderboard requests are in-flight.
  - Added request-id guard in `openCommunityHub()` catch path to avoid race-based stale overwrite.
- Community week alignment fix:
  - Added `getWeekKeyUtc()` and switched community-only week keys/state to UTC to match cloud API week bucketing.
  - Local community leaderboard response now returns UTC week key.
- Reduced perceived hangs:
  - `fetchWithTimeout` lowered from 15s to 8s.
- Local fallback usage in leaderboard refresh is now explicit (`localApiFetch`) rather than re-entering cloud fetch paths.

### Validation
- `index.html` script parse smoke test passed (`new Function` parse).
- Playwright loop still blocked in this environment because `playwright` package is missing.

### Remaining TODOs / next agent
- Install `playwright` and run `develop-web-game` loop to visually verify:
  - login failure messaging under cloud 5xx/network faults
  - leaderboard tab switching (All Time / This Week / Community) with no stale carryover
  - community contribution visibility across UTC week boundary scenarios

## Update 9: Chromium Playwright validation run (post-install)
- Installed Playwright in project and validated Chromium launch.
- Because the skill client script resolves modules from its own directory, ran it from a copied local path (`tmp_web_game_playwright_client.mjs`) so project `node_modules/playwright` is used.
- Ran action-loop screenshots at `output/web-game/shot-0.png..shot-2.png` and manually inspected them.
- Ran direct Playwright Chromium validation script for auth + leaderboard behavior:
  - Signup/login success path: pass
  - Bad password path returns `Invalid username or password`: pass
  - Simulated `/api/login` 503 displays server error (`Server Down`) instead of silent local fallback: pass
  - Leaderboard tabs render distinct data/layouts (Community vs Weekly): pass
  - Weekly leaderboard row rendering after score submission: pass
  - Community contributions render in community tab when present: pass
- Noted expected local-dev caveat with `server.js`: several cloud worker routes are absent, so local mode may show `Cloud API routes not found...` message in this environment. This is environment-specific and not from Chromium/Playwright failure.

## Update 10: Keyboard sound pack compatibility (`config.json` multi/single)
- Added compatibility layer for downloadable keyboard sound pack formats:
  - Supports `key_define_type: "multi"` (per-key filename mapping).
  - Supports `key_define_type: "single"` (audio sprite slicing via `[startMs, durationMs]` from a single sound file).
- Added event-to-keycode mapping to resolve `defines` entries by legacy key code IDs used by pack configs.
- Added lazy pack config loading from `<pack>/config.json` with safe fallback to legacy `*.wav` mapping when config is missing/invalid.
- Added runtime pack switch helper:
  - `window.setKeySoundPack('<folder-name>')`
  - persisted to localStorage key `sampire-key-sound-pack`.
- Boot now restores selected key sound pack from localStorage and preloads its config.
- Updated keypress sound call sites to pass keyboard event context for accurate keycode mapping.

### Validation
- JS parse smoke check passed.
- Browser smoke check passed with `setKeySoundPack('cherrymx-blue-abs')`:
  - no console/page errors
  - keypress dispatch (letter/space/backspace) executed with pack enabled
  - selected pack persisted (`sampire-key-sound-pack=cherrymx-blue-abs`).

## Update 11: GitHub deployment + comprehensive production Playwright audit
- Deployed latest changes to GitHub `main`:
  - remote: `https://github.com/sampire21/sampires-glorious-typing-test.git`
  - commit pushed: `6ea28e5` (`Fix auth/leaderboard reliability and add key sound pack menu`)
- Ran comprehensive Playwright production audit against `https://type.sherathia.com`:
  - script: `output/full_prod_audit_v2.cjs`
  - summary artifact: `output/playwright-full/summary.json`
  - screenshots captured: `output/playwright-full/01-home.png` through `10-account-modal.png` (plus follow-up shots)
- Core functional coverage that passed:
  - page load + top controls
  - key sounds dropdown options and pack switching (`NK Creams`, `Cherry MX Blues`)
  - mode switching (`Quotes`, `Random Words`, `Words 30s`, `Challenges`)
  - typing interaction metrics update
  - leaderboard tabs render distinct layouts (`All Time`/`This Week` score columns vs `Community Goal` damage columns)
  - leaderboard username hover tooltip includes: `Level`, `Achievements`, `Total Community Damage`, `Personal Best WPM`
  - auth bad-credentials message path (`Invalid username or password`)
- Follow-up targeted Playwright checks:
  - `output/full_prod_followup_v3.cjs` validated community hub opens from clean state and account management modal opens.
  - additional isolated auth lifecycle script confirmed signup -> logout -> re-login success (`output/auth_lifecycle_check.cjs` run result pass).
- Notes:
  - Initial failures in the large suite were mostly harness-level modal-overlay click interception (attempting to click background controls while a modal remained open), not functional regressions.
  - One expected network item appears during bad-login scenario: `401 /api/login`.

## Update 12: Targeted re-check for previously ambiguous cases
- Ran focused Playwright follow-up with retries/modal-safe sequencing:
  - script: `output/targeted_summary_final.cjs`
  - summary: `output/playwright-full/targeted-summary-final.json`
- All targeted checks passed:
  - leaderboard hover tooltip includes Level/Achievements/Total Community Damage/Personal Best WPM
  - signup -> logout -> re-login lifecycle
  - account management modal accessibility from profile

## Update 13: Achievement persistence hardening
- Addressed report that achievements were not consistently retained after deploy/reload.
- Added immediate progress flush when a badge is awarded (`awardBadge -> flushProgressSyncNow()`), so unlocks are pushed to `/api/progress` without waiting for debounce.
- Added pre-logout flush (`logoutUser`) to reduce risk of losing queued progress before token/session teardown.
- Added unload/hidden flush hooks:
  - `document.visibilitychange` flushes when tab becomes hidden.
  - `window.pagehide` flushes before page unload/navigation.
- JS parse smoke test passed after patch.

## Update 14: Leaderboard hover achievements freshness fix
- Addressed issue where unlocked achievements did not appear in leaderboard hover consistently.
- Added username-normalized cache helpers for hover summary data:
  - `normalizeSummaryUsername`
  - `invalidateLeaderboardUserSummaryCache`
- On badge unlock (`awardBadge`), now invalidates the current user’s hover-summary cache key before syncing.
- In `fetchLeaderboardUserSummary`, for the currently logged-in user, merges local earned badges into fetched badge IDs so newly unlocked achievements appear immediately in hover (without waiting for cache TTL/cloud readback).
- JS parse smoke test passed.

## Update 15: PWA installability support
- Added PWA manifest file: `manifest.webmanifest`
  - name/short_name, standalone display, theme/background colors, scope/start_url
  - icons configured for 192 and 512 sizes (including maskable entry)
- Generated app icons from existing `Favicon.png`:
  - `icons/icon-192.png`
  - `icons/icon-512.png`
  - `icons/apple-touch-icon.png`
- Added service worker: `sw.js`
  - pre-caches app shell assets
  - network-first for navigations
  - stale-while-revalidate for static same-origin GET assets

## Update 16: Sector map starlight accessibility shine
- Implemented conditional accessible-system starlight behavior using `.sector-node.is-unlocked` and `.sector-node.is-locked` classes.
- Added/used `#starlight-glow` SVG filter with `feGaussianBlur` to create a soft aura around accessible system halos.
- Added `pulse-starlight` animation loop and hover/focus amplification for accessible stars:
  - faster pulse and brighter glow on interaction to indicate readiness for travel.
- Enforced "cold" locked systems:
  - dimmed/greyed core + halo
  - no pulse animation/filter glow
  - removed keyboard focus from locked nodes (`tabindex="-1"`).
- Added computed access resolution (`isAccessible`) from either `requiredLevel` or explicit `unlocked` path state.
- Updated tactical overlay to reflect real-time accessibility:
  - shows `Travel Ready` for accessible systems
  - shows lock requirement (`Locked until level X`) when inaccessible.

### Validation
- `index.html` script parse smoke test passed (`new Function` parse).
- Playwright smoke run executed (`output/starlight-check/shot-0.png`); no runtime JS errors from this feature were reported.
  - bypasses cache for `/api/*` requests
- Wired install metadata/registration in `index.html`:
  - `<link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/manifest.webmanifest\">`
  - theme color + iOS web app meta tags
  - apple touch icon link
  - service worker registration on window `load`

### Validation
- `manifest.webmanifest` JSON parse: pass.
- `sw.js` syntax check: pass.
- Chromium localhost check: service worker registered successfully with scope `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`.

## Update 16: Inventory persistence + top-right music theme selector
- Fixed unlock persistence loss on login by hardening cloud hydration merge:
  - Added `mergeProgressSnapshotsForSameOwner(remote, local)` and use it during `hydrateProgressForCurrentUser()` when owner matches.
  - Merge behavior now preserves same-user unlock state if remote snapshot is stale/partial:
    - skill unlocks (`sampire-skills`) use boolean OR semantics
    - badge list (`sampire-badges`) is unioned by id
    - key unlock-related fields are preserved from local when missing remotely
  - If merge changed state, it now pushes merged progress back to cloud immediately.
- Added immediate progress flushes for inventory/reward changes:
  - `saveSkillsState`, `saveRewardSettings`, `setRewardActive`, and `spendSkillPoint` now flush.
- Added top-right Music menu (click the Music button to open):
  - Theme options:
    - `Dark Main Theme`
    - `Your Own Personal Universe`
  - `Toggle On / Off` mute option in the menu
  - Active theme highlighting
  - Universe theme is disabled/locked unless `soundscapes` reward is unlocked
  - Escape/outside-click closes the music menu

### Validation
- JS parse smoke test passed.
- Playwright localhost checks:
  - Music menu opens and options render with active-state classes.
  - Local storage values for skills/reward settings persist across reload.
  - Merge helper test confirms remote/local union keeps unlocks and badges when remote is stale.

## Update 17: Music cutoff/restart mitigation for long tracks
- Addressed intermittent issue where `Your Own Personal Universe` could restart mid-song.
- Changes:
  - `playThemeSoundtrack()` is now idempotent: if active track is already playing, it does not call `play()` again.
  - `retryThemeMusicAfterGesture()` now exits early (and clears gesture-needed flag) if the active track is already playing.
  - Removed manual `ended` restart handlers for theme tracks and rely on `audio.loop = true` only.
- Goal: prevent redundant play/restart calls from focus/gesture events that can interrupt long playback on some browsers.
- JS parse smoke test passed.

## Update 18: Quotes Bible Mode framework
- Added Bible Mode toggle UI beside WPM in typing stats (`Quotes` mode only).
- Added persistent preference key: `sampire-bible-mode` and included it in progress sync keys.
- Added quote routing helpers:
  - uses `window.BIBLE_VERSES` when Bible Mode is enabled and dataset is present
  - falls back to default `QUOTES` with a one-time info toast if no verses are loaded
- Updated New Test label behavior:
  - quotes mode + bible off: `New Quote`
  - quotes mode + bible on: `New Verse`
  - word modes: `New Words`
- Added placeholder data file:
  - `bible-verses.js` (empty `window.BIBLE_VERSES` array with expected object shape comments)
  - included in HTML before main app script

### Validation
- Inline script parse check passed.
- Local Playwright smoke check passed:
  - words mode hides Bible toggle
  - quotes mode shows Bible toggle
  - toggling Bible mode updates button label to `New Verse`
  - no startup JS errors.

## Update 19: Bible toggle visual adjustment
- Updated Bible Mode control styling per request:
  - removed boxed/stat-card look
  - now renders as a plain inline toggle to the left of WPM
  - retains quote-mode-only visibility and existing behavior
- JS parse smoke test passed after style/markup update.

## Update 16: Community boost game modes (in progress)
- Added community boost mode system scaffolding:
  - `targeted_weakness` and `kinetic_shielding` definitions.
  - runtime state helpers and damage computation helpers.
- Added Community Hub mode cards with start/disable actions.
- `Targeted Weakness` now generates X/Z-heavy passages and emits laser icon effect on X/Z keypress.
- `Kinetic Shielding` runtime now tracks dodge progress while maintaining WPM above baseline.
- Results now submit boosted community damage (`addCommunityWeeklyWords` + `submitCommunityContribution`) instead of raw typed word count when a boost mode is active.
- JS parse smoke check passed.

## Update 17: Community boost mode verification
- Ran local parse smoke check for inline script: pass.
- Ran develop-web-game Playwright client against `http://127.0.0.1:3000` with screenshots to `output/web-game-community/`.
- Added targeted feature Playwright checks (`output/community_modes_check.cjs`) and validated:
  - Community Hub shows both new boost cards.
  - `Targeted Weakness` starts quote test with source label `Community Mode: Targeted Weakness`.
  - X/Z keypress spawns `.xz-laser-icon` effect.
  - Targeted helper damage sample (`3 words`, 2 X/Z matches) returns `7` damage.
  - `Kinetic Shielding` starts words30 with baseline in source label.
  - Shield runtime state initializes and dodge count increments over time while WPM stays above baseline.
- Screenshot inspected: `output/community-hub-modes.png` confirms new mode UI in community modal.

### Remaining TODOs
- Consider adding an explicit in-run HUD indicator for shield dodge progress (e.g., `Dodges: 2/5`) while kinetic mode is active.
- If desired, expose a small post-result line showing exact boosted damage submitted each run.

## Update 16: Music + keyboard volume sliders
- Added volume slider controls inside both top-bar menus:
  - `Music` dropdown now has a `Volume` slider (`#music-volume-slider`) with live percentage label.
  - `Key Sounds` dropdown now has a `Volume` slider (`#keysound-volume-slider`) with live percentage label.
- Implemented persisted volume settings:
  - `sampire-music-volume` (default `0.35`)
  - `sampire-key-sound-volume` (default `1`)
- Wired music volume to all relevant tracks:
  - main theme tracks (`dark`, `universe`)
  - reward preview track (`soundscapePreviewAudio`)
- Wired key sound volume to keypress audio playback:
  - pool creation and runtime playback now respect `keySoundVolume`
  - sprite-segment playback also applies configured key volume
- Added UI sync helpers so slider values and percentage labels stay current when menus open and when values change.
- Added both new volume keys to progress-sync handling so preferences can travel with synced profile data.

### Validation
- `index.html` script parse smoke check passed (`new Function` parse).
- Ran Playwright UI verification against local server:
  - setting music slider to `12` updated label to `12%` and persisted `sampire-music-volume=0.12`
  - setting key sound slider to `67` updated label to `67%` and persisted `sampire-key-sound-volume=0.67`
  - after reload, both labels restored to persisted values
  - no page/console errors during the interaction run
- Ran `develop-web-game` client loop and captured screenshots in `output/web-game-volume/` (`shot-0.png`..`shot-2.png`).

## Update 17: Beta achievement `Founder` (auto-unlock for all accounts)
- Added new achievement definition:
  - id: `founder`
  - name: `Founder`
  - desc: `Created an account during the beta period`
- Added beta gate flag:
  - `const BETA_FOUNDER_ACHIEVEMENT_ENABLED = true;`
  - flip this to `false` later to stop automatic Founder grants.
- Added `ensureFounderBadgeForBeta()` helper and wired it into auth lifecycle:
  - after `hydrateProgressForCurrentUser()` in `signupUser`
  - after `hydrateProgressForCurrentUser()` in `loginUser`
  - after `hydrateProgressForCurrentUser()` in `restoreSession`
- Result: while beta flag is `true`, any authenticated account automatically gets `Founder` once.
- Updated achievement ID lists used by admin set-achievements flows:
  - local fallback admin patch route inside `index.html`
  - cloud route `functions/api/admin/users/[id].js`

### Validation
- `index.html` script parse smoke test passed (`new Function` parse).
- Playwright signup flow check against local server:
  - new account signup succeeded
  - `founder` stored in `sampire-badges`
  - `Founder` appears in profile content
  - `BADGE_DEFS` includes `founder`
- Ran `develop-web-game` client loop and inspected screenshots in `output/web-game-founder/`.

## Update 18: New achievement `The Human Lectionary`
- Added new achievement definition:
  - id: `human_lectionary`
  - name: `The Human Lectionary`
  - desc: `Complete 100 Bible Mode typing tests`
- Added Bible-mode history counting helper:
  - `getBibleModeTestCount()`
  - Counts both:
    - new entries with explicit `bibleMode: true`
    - legacy quote entries whose text matches known Bible verse pool text
- Added new badge unlock rule in `checkBadges(...)`:
  - awards `human_lectionary` when `getBibleModeTestCount() >= 100`
- Enhanced history persistence for future runs:
  - `scoreEntry` now includes `bibleMode: currentMode === 'quotes' && bibleModeEnabled`
- Updated admin achievement lists to include the new badge id:
  - local fallback admin patch route in `index.html`
  - cloud admin route in `functions/api/admin/users/[id].js`

### Validation
- `index.html` parse smoke check passed.
- Playwright validation (local):
  - legacy-style 100 Bible quote entries counted correctly (`countFromLegacy: 100`)
  - new-format `bibleMode: true` entries counted correctly (`countFromFlagged: 100`)
  - `checkBadges` returns `human_lectionary` and badge is stored in `sampire-badges`
  - badge definition present in `BADGE_DEFS`
  - no console/page errors in targeted run
- Ran `develop-web-game` client loop and inspected screenshots in `output/web-game-lectionary/`.

## Update 19: Fix result-race bug (spacebar after final word causing 0-score results)
- Fixed a race condition between completion and global spacebar shortcut handling.
- Root cause:
  - After the final character, `isComplete` is set and `showResults(...)` is queued with a timeout.
  - The same/next immediate spacebar key event reached the global keydown handler before results fully opened.
  - Global handler interpreted it as "start new test", resetting state and resulting in 0-valued result stats.
- Implemented guard state:
  - Added `resultsPendingOpen` boolean in typing state.
  - Set to `true` whenever completion queues `showResults` (timed and non-timed paths).
  - Cleared in `showResults(...)` and in `init(...)`.
  - In global keydown handler: if `resultsPendingOpen && e.key === ' '`, consume event and do nothing.
- Behavior after fix:
  - Space pressed during the completion -> results transition no longer starts a new test.
  - Space still starts a new test normally when results overlay is already open.

### Validation
- `index.html` parse smoke check passed.
- Playwright targeted repro:
  - deterministic short test completed
  - immediate post-completion `Space` no longer reset run
  - results overlay opened with non-zero metrics from completed run
- Playwright behavior check:
  - pressing `Space` after results are open still starts a fresh test as intended.
- Ran `develop-web-game` client loop and inspected screenshots in `output/web-game-space-fix/`.

## Update 20: Profile `Lifetime Stats` button + dedicated stats modal
- Added a new `Lifetime Stats` button to the profile modal header actions.
- Added a new modal:
  - `#lifetime-stats-modal`
  - opens from profile via `openLifetimeStatsModal()`
  - closes via close button, backdrop, and `Esc`
- Added lifetime stats renderer:
  - `renderLifetimeStatsModal()`
  - shows all-time totals for Tests, Words Typed, Time Typed, Best WPM, Bible Tests, Level, Current Streak, Challenges, Achievements, Avg Words/Test.

### Data model improvements for true lifetime tracking
- Added persistent lifetime counters (localStorage + progress sync):
  - `sampire-lifetime-tests-completed`
  - `sampire-lifetime-words-typed`
  - `sampire-lifetime-time-seconds`
  - `sampire-lifetime-best-wpm`
  - `sampire-lifetime-bible-tests-completed`
- Added helpers:
  - `getHistoryDerivedLifetimeStats()`
  - `getLifetimeStatsSummary()`
  - `recordLifetimeRunStats(...)`
  - `formatLifetimeDuration(...)`
- Wired run completion to update lifetime counters in `showResults()`.
- Added the lifetime counter keys to sync and critical storage handling.
- Added merge-preserve behavior for new lifetime keys in `mergeProgressSnapshotsForSameOwner()`.

### Related correction
- Updated `getBibleModeTestCount()` to use lifetime summary counters.
  - This fixes long-run unlock viability for `The Human Lectionary` (100 Bible mode tests), which was previously constrained by capped local history.

### Validation
- `index.html` script parse smoke check passed.
- Targeted Playwright checks:
  - signup -> profile -> click `Lifetime Stats` opens modal successfully
  - modal content renders populated totals
  - `Esc` closes lifetime stats modal
  - lifetime summary increments after completed test
- Ran `develop-web-game` client loop and inspected screenshots in `output/web-game-lifetime-stats/`.

## Update 21: Shop-gated keyboard sound packs + inline typing preview
- Added keyboard sound packs (excluding NK Creams) to the shop at `1 SP` each:
  - Cherry MX Blues (`cherrymx-blue-abs`)
  - Buckling Springs (`Buckling Springs`)
  - Cherry MX Blacks (`Cherry MX Blacks`)
  - Cherry MX Browns (`Cherry MX Browns`)
  - Cherry MX Reds (`Cherry MX Reds`)
- Added a new shop section `Keyboard Sound Packs` in `renderSkillsModal()` with one card per pack.
- Each pack card now includes a `Preview` typing field:
  - users can type directly in the small input box and hear that pack without equipping it.
  - wired via `handleShopKeySoundPreviewKeydown(event, packName)`.

### Unlock / gating behavior
- Added purchasable unlock flow `unlockShopKeySoundPack(packName)`:
  - costs `1 SP`, deducts points, stores unlock in skills state, refreshes shop/menu UI.
- Key sound menu now enforces locked state:
  - locked packs are disabled and shown as locked until purchased.
  - selecting a locked pack shows a message and does nothing.
- NK Creams remains default and always unlocked.

### Data model + sync updates
- Extended `sampire-skills` state with `keySoundPacks` unlock map.
- Updated `getSkillsState()`/`saveSkillsState()` to persist pack unlocks.
- Updated progress merge logic so cloud/local sync preserves key-sound-pack unlocks (`mergeProgressSnapshotsForSameOwner`).

### Audio preview plumbing
- Added pack-specific preview playback path:
  - `getKeySoundBaseForPack(packName)`
  - `loadKeySoundPackConfigByName(packName)` with cache
  - `resolveConfigBasedKeySoundSpecForPack(...)`
  - `playKeypressSoundForPack(...)`
- Preview playback supports both config modes (`multi` and `single`) and uses existing audio pool logic.

### Bugfix discovered during validation
- Fixed boot-time skill cache regression where `getSkillsState()` could cache fallback data before `SKILLS_KEY` const initialization path.
- `getSkillsState()`/`saveSkillsState()` now use literal storage key `'sampire-skills'`, preventing transient false-lock states after reload.

### Validation
- `index.html` parse smoke test passed.
- Targeted Playwright checks:
  - packs are locked/disabled in key-sound menu before purchase
  - buying a pack consumes exactly `1 SP`
  - preview typing field triggers key sound pool activity (sound path exercised)
  - unlocked pack remains unlocked after reload and can be selected from key-sound menu
  - no JS runtime exceptions in targeted flow
- Ran `develop-web-game` client loop and inspected screenshots in `output/web-game-shop-keypacks/`.

## Update 22: Shop visual redesign (game-card style)
- Restyled shop item cards to a bold arcade/mobile-game look inspired by provided reference:
  - stronger panel framing and depth
  - bright orange title plates
  - high-contrast cost chips and accent pricing
  - larger, punchier buy buttons
  - stronger hover lift/shadow treatment
- Updated supporting controls in cards:
  - preview input fields and notes now match the new game-card visual language
  - locked key-sound menu options keep clear visual lock state
- Kept existing behavior/functionality intact while only changing visual treatment.

### Visual validation
- Captured dedicated shop preview screenshot:
  - `output/shop-style-preview.png`
- Ran `develop-web-game` client loop and inspected screenshots in:
  - `output/web-game-shop-style/`

## Update 23: Profile improvement tracking graph (WPM progress)
- Enhanced profile progress tracking to make improvement visible over time.
- Data pipeline update:
  - `loadProfileData()` now merges local run history with fetched score rows (`mergeProfileScores(...)`) so profile progression charts are based on sequential runs, not just sparse cloud snapshots.
  - If cloud fetch fails, profile now still renders from local history instead of showing a blocking error.
- Chart/UX update:
  - Renamed chart section to `WPM Progress (raw + rolling avg)`.
  - `drawProfileTrendChart(...)` now renders:
    - raw WPM trend line
    - rolling average overlay line (adaptive window)
    - legend labels for raw vs rolling average
- Result: players can clearly see whether they are improving over recent tests rather than only seeing isolated point values.

### Validation
- `index.html` parse smoke test passed.
- Targeted Playwright validation produced a profile screenshot showing:
  - WPM Progress chart
  - rolling average line + legend
  - expected rendering without JS exceptions
  - artifact: `output/profile-trend-preview.png`
- Ran `develop-web-game` client loop and inspected screenshots in `output/web-game-profile-progress/`.

## Update 24: Auth hardening phase 1 (rate limiting + response headers)
- Added baseline API security headers to JSON responses in `functions/api/_lib.js`:
  - `x-content-type-options: nosniff`
  - `x-frame-options: DENY`
  - `referrer-policy: no-referrer`
  - `permissions-policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()`
  - `cross-origin-resource-policy: same-origin`
- Added reusable request hardening helpers in `_lib.js`:
  - `getClientIp(request)` for Cloudflare/forwarded IP extraction
  - `safeRateKeyPart(...)` for sanitized rate-limit key segments
  - `incrementRateLimit(env, key, windowSec, nowMs?)` for KV-window counters with TTL-based expiry

### Login/signup rate limiting
- `functions/api/login.js`
  - Per-IP limiter: `30` attempts per `10` minutes
  - Per-username limiter: `12` attempts per `10` minutes
  - Returns HTTP `429` with `{ code: 'RATE_LIMITED', retryAfter }` on exceed
- `functions/api/signup.js`
  - Per-IP limiter: `12` attempts per `1` hour
  - Per-username limiter: `6` attempts per `1` hour
  - Returns HTTP `429` with `{ code: 'RATE_LIMITED', retryAfter }` on exceed

### Worker API error/404 response hardening
- `worker.js` now includes no-store + basic defensive headers on API error/404 JSON responses for consistent safe defaults.

### Validation notes
- Direct `node --check` syntax validation is limited by the repo’s Worker module setup (`.js` ESM files parsed as CJS by Node in this environment).
- Changes were verified by direct diff inspection and constrained to additive hardening paths.

## Update 25: Auth hardening phase 2 (HttpOnly cookie sessions)
- Migrated cloud auth flow from client-stored bearer token to server-managed session cookie.
- Added cookie helpers in `functions/api/_lib.js`:
  - `buildSessionCookie(request, token)`
  - `clearSessionCookie(request)`
  - `getAuthTokenFromRequest(request)` (cookie-first, auth header fallback)
- Extended `json(...)` helper to accept extra headers, enabling secure `Set-Cookie` responses while keeping default API security headers.

### API changes
- `POST /api/login` now sets `sampire_session` HttpOnly cookie and returns `{ user }` (no cloud token in response body).
- `POST /api/signup` now sets `sampire_session` HttpOnly cookie and returns `{ user }`.
- Added `POST /api/logout` to clear session cookie.
- Updated worker routing to include `/api/logout`.

### Frontend session changes
- Cloud auth now relies on browser cookie session restore (`/api/me`) instead of localStorage token persistence.
- `fetchWithTimeout(...)` now uses `credentials: 'same-origin'` so auth cookies are sent on API calls.
- Added `LOCAL_AUTH_TOKEN_KEY` for local-browser fallback mode only (`local-token:*`).
- Legacy cloud token key (`sampire-auth-token`) is now cleanup-only and removed during restore/logout.
- Updated auth checks so cloud-synced flows gate on `currentUser` rather than `authToken`.
- Added local fallback `/api/logout` handler in browser-local API shim for parity.

### Validation
- `index.html` script parse smoke check passed (`new Function` parse).
- ESM bundle/syntax validation passed via `esbuild` for modified API/worker files.
- Ran `develop-web-game` Playwright client loop (copied client script into repo path so local `playwright` dependency resolves).
  - Artifacts: `output/web-game-phase2/shot-0.png`, `output/web-game-phase2/errors-0.json`
  - Observed a static-server 404 resource console error in this loop; no new auth-flow runtime JS exceptions surfaced in this pass.

### Notes
- Local browser fallback mode still uses a local bearer token by design; cloud mode no longer stores auth tokens in localStorage.

## Update 26: Auth hardening phase 3 (rotating refresh + session revocation)
- Implemented split-token session model:
  - short-lived access token cookie (`sampire_session`, 15 minutes)
  - rotating refresh token cookie (`sampire_refresh`, 30 days)
- Both cookies are issued as `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`, and `Secure` on HTTPS.

### Backend session model
- Added auth session records in KV (`auth-session:<sid>`) with:
  - `uid`, `refreshJti`, `refreshExp`, `revoked`, `createdAt`, `lastSeenAt`, `lastRotatedAt`
- Added helper APIs in `functions/api/_lib.js` for:
  - token payload creation by type (`access` / `refresh`)
  - cookie build/clear for access + refresh cookies
  - session record create/save/revoke
  - token extraction and verification from request cookies
- `getAuthUser(...)` now validates:
  - signed access token
  - token type (`access`)
  - session record exists (when `sid` present), not revoked, uid matches, refresh window still active

### Endpoint changes
- `POST /api/login` and `POST /api/signup`:
  - now mint session record + access/refresh cookies
  - still return `{ user }` JSON body
- Added `POST /api/refresh` (`functions/api/refresh.js`):
  - validates refresh token + session record
  - rotates refresh `jti` on each call
  - issues fresh access + refresh cookies
  - on refresh token replay/mismatch, revokes session and clears cookies
- `POST /api/logout` now:
  - attempts to resolve session from access/refresh token
  - revokes matched session in KV
  - clears both cookies

### Frontend behavior
- Added automatic one-shot refresh retry on cloud `401` responses for API calls (excluding login/signup/refresh/logout):
  - client calls `/api/refresh`
  - on success, retries original request
  - on unauthorized refresh, clears in-memory cloud user state
- Kept local fallback mode working with `local-token:*` auth.
- Added local shim support for `POST /api/refresh` in `localApiFetch(...)`.

### Validation
- `index.html` script parse smoke check passed.
- ESM bundle/syntax validation passed with `esbuild` for all modified API/worker files.
- Ran Playwright loop artifacts (`output/web-game-phase3/`): no new auth-flow runtime JS exceptions surfaced; one static-server file 404 console error persisted in this environment.

## Update 6: Visual refresh preview pass (no logic changes)
- Added a dedicated CSS override block (`#ui-refresh-preview`) in `index.html` right before `</head>`.
- Scope: visual polish only (palette, card surfaces, tab/button styling, quote panel, modal cards, progress bar, readability colors).
- No gameplay/state/auth/leaderboard JavaScript changes in this pass.
- Goal: provide a reviewable UI preview before deciding whether to keep/refine/push.

## Update 7: UI preview screenshots captured
- Started local server (`npm start`) and captured full-page previews with Playwright.
- Saved screenshots:
  - `output/ui-preview/home-full.png`
  - `output/ui-preview/leaderboard-modal.png`
  - `output/ui-preview/login-modal.png`
- Note: local client script (`tmp_web_game_playwright_client.mjs`) captured only chart canvas by default and logged expected API console errors for unauth cloud endpoints (401/404) in this environment; full-page captures were produced with direct Playwright script.

## Update 16: Words 30s compact scrolling typing bar
- Implemented a dedicated compact typing viewport for timed mode (`Words 30s`):
  - Added `.quote-display.words30-compact` styling to replace the large wrapped text block with a smaller single-line bar.
  - Enabled horizontal overflow for the compact bar and hid the scrollbar visuals.
  - Added mobile-specific compact sizing overrides under the existing responsive media query.
- Added viewport behavior wiring:
  - `shouldUseCompactTypingViewport()`
  - `updateTypingViewportMode(resetScroll)`
  - `syncTypingViewportScroll(resetScroll)`
- The compact mode is toggled during mode switches and test init; scroll position resets when appropriate.
- As the user types/backspaces, the bar auto-scrolls so the active cursor remains in view.
- Added resize handling to keep cursor visibility stable after viewport changes.

### Validation
- JS parse smoke check passed (`new Function` parse over `<script>` block).
- Playwright skill client run executed (artifact: `output/web-game-words30/shot-0.png`; limited to canvas-only capture for this app).
- Targeted Playwright DOM validation (elevated due sandbox browser constraints):
  - artifact screenshot: `output/words30-compact-check/quote-display-after-typing.png`
  - state artifact: `output/words30-compact-check/state-after-typing.json`
  - confirmed compact class + horizontal scroll movement while typing:
    - `className`: `quote-display words30-compact focused`
    - `scrollLeft`: `2334` (`> 0`, proving scroll advances)
- Console errors observed during local checks are pre-existing local API noise (`401`/`404`), no new JS runtime exceptions introduced by this change.

## Update 17: Challenges tab collapsible Daily/Weekly dropdown sections
- Changed Challenges UI behavior so Daily and Weekly quest lists are no longer always visible when entering `Challenges` mode.
- Added per-section dropdown toggle buttons in each header:
  - Daily Challenges toggle
  - Weekly Challenges toggle
- Both sections now default to collapsed and expand/collapse independently.
- Added `challengeSectionsOpen` state + helpers:
  - `isChallengeSectionOpen(section)`
  - `toggleChallengeSection(section)` (exported on `window` for header button handlers)
- Updated `renderDailyChallenges()` to conditionally render each section's quest cards only when expanded.
- Updated `jumpToChallengeFromProgress(challengeId)` to auto-expand the correct section (daily/weekly) before attempting to scroll to the target card, preserving existing progress deep-link UX.

### Validation
- JS parse smoke check passed (`new Function` parse over `index.html` script block).

## Update 18: Community Goal section added under Weekly Challenges
- Added a new `Community Goal` section below Weekly Challenges in the Challenges tab (`renderDailyChallenges`).
- Reused the existing invasion/alien fleet card renderer via `getCommunityHubCardHtml()` so the full battle visualization is visible directly from Challenges.
- Added `Open Hub` button in the new section header to jump to the full Community Hub modal.
- Added a lightweight cache seed in challenge render (`_communityRowsCache = getCommunityContributionRows()`) when cache is empty, so local contribution progress still shows in this section.

### Validation
- JS parse smoke check passed (`new Function` parse over `index.html` script block).

## Update 19: Community Hub emergency transmission visual theme
- Reskinned only the Community Hub modal (`#community-hub-modal`) to a distinct "spaceship emergency transmission" UI treatment.
- Added Community Hub specific styling (scoped under `#community-hub-modal`) so other menus are unchanged:
  - alert-red/teal backdrop and modal glow
  - terminal-style panel background with scanline overlays
  - hazard-striped command header + `EMERGENCY TRANSMISSION` status text
  - monospaced, uppercase signal typography for key headings
  - red-alert progress bars and control surfaces
  - stronger segmented panel look for goal card, mode cards, and leaderboard rows
- Added mobile guard to hide the emergency header status text on small screens to avoid header crowding.

### Validation
- JS parse smoke check passed (`new Function` parse over `index.html` script block).

## Update 20: Locked music/key-sound click popup to Shop
- Added a cursor-anchored popup for locked music/theme and key sound pack selections:
  - popup text: `Unlock in the shop!`
  - appears near latest pointer position
  - clicking popup closes the sound menus and opens the Shop modal (`openSkills()`)
- Updated menu option handlers to pass click event context:
  - `selectMusicTheme(theme, event)`
  - `selectKeySoundPack(packName, event)`
- Locked options are now clickable (no `disabled` attribute) so they can trigger the popup instead of silently blocking input.
- Added popup styling and fade-in animation (`.unlock-shop-hint`, `@keyframes unlockHintPopIn`).
- Added pointer tracking + outside-click cleanup for popup lifecycle.

### Validation
- JS parse smoke check passed (`new Function` parse over `index.html` script block).

## Update 21: Shop purchase animation + Purchase 1 SFX hook
- Added purchase highlight animation for newly bought shop items:
  - `.skill-card.purchase-fx` with `@keyframes shopPurchasePulse`.
- Added purchase effect state management:
  - `shopPurchaseFxKey`, `shopPurchaseFxExpiresAt`
  - `triggerShopPurchaseFx(key)`
  - `getShopPurchaseFxClass(key)`
- Wired purchase effect to both buy paths:
  - reward unlocks via `spendSkillPoint(skillId)`
  - key sound pack unlocks via `unlockShopKeySoundPack(packName)`
- Updated `renderSkillsModal()` card classes so only the purchased card gets the temporary animated pulse.
- Added `SFX.purchase1` using `Sound Effects/Purchase 1.wav`.

### Note
- In the current workspace listing, `Sound Effects/Purchase 1.wav` was not present. The hook is now in place and will play automatically once that file exists at that path.

### Validation
- JS parse smoke check passed (`new Function` parse over `index.html` script block).

## Update 22: Inventory categories + keyboard sound pack ownership visibility
- Reworked Inventory modal into three category sections:
  - `Soundscapes`
  - `Cosmetics`
  - `Keyboard Sound Packs`
- Added category-specific empty states so each section communicates unlock status independently.
- Added keyboard sound pack ownership rendering in inventory using `SHOP_KEY_SOUND_PACKS` + `isKeySoundPackUnlocked(...)`.
- Added inventory equip action for keyboard sound packs:
  - new `equipKeySoundPackFromInventory(packName)`
  - sets active pack, enables key sounds, refreshes menus, and re-renders inventory.
- Added `Equipped` state/metadata for currently active pack.
- Added supporting inventory section styles (`inventory-section`, `inventory-section-title`, `inventory-section-empty`, `inventory-item-meta`).

### Validation
- JS parse smoke check passed (`new Function` parse over `index.html` script block).

## Update 23: Reward naming + inventory preview panel refresh
- Renamed reward display names in Shop and Inventory:
  - `Soundscapes Reward` -> `Your Own Personal Universe`
  - `Aura Reward` -> `Word Glow`
  - `Nebula Trail Reward` -> `Nebula Trail`
- Updated `spendSkillPoint` labels so unlock/error messages use the new reward names.
- Removed emoji icons from reward listings/titles in Inventory category cards/headers.
- Reworked Inventory reward cards to include a right-side preview panel (similar to Shop preview layout):
  - `Word Glow` uses clickable glow word preview.
  - `Nebula Trail` uses clickable trail stage preview.
  - `Your Own Personal Universe` uses play/pause preview control.
- Added reusable preview helpers with target IDs for inventory-specific preview elements:
  - `previewAuraRewardAt(targetId)`
  - `previewNebulaTrailRewardAt(stageId)`

### Validation
- JS parse smoke check passed (`new Function` parse over `index.html` script block).

## Update 24: Mining FX toggle + asteroid mining visuals
- Added new UI toggle beside Ghost Cursor: `Mining FX: On/Off` (`#mining-fx-toggle-btn`).
- Added persisted preference key `sampire-mining-visuals-enabled` with load/update/toggle wiring:
  - `loadMiningVisualsPreference()`
  - `updateMiningFxToggleButton()`
  - `toggleMiningVisuals()`
- Added purple asteroid shatter effect on completed words:
  - `maybeTriggerMiningShatter(typedIndex)`
  - `emitMiningShatterAtWord(wordIndex)`
  - Triggered from typing flow when a correctly typed character completes a word boundary.
- Added mining laser overlay from bottom of viewport to active word:
  - DOM: `#mining-laser-overlay`
  - `updateMiningLaserAtActiveWord()` updates beam angle/length/width/hue.
  - Laser color/width scales with WPM.
  - Overlay clears when hidden/disabled/results/daily mode.
- Added supporting CSS animations/styles:
  - `.mining-shatter-particle`, `@keyframes miningShatterBurst`
  - `.mining-laser-overlay`, `.mining-laser-beam`, `.mining-laser-core`, `@keyframes miningLaserPulse`

### Validation (Update 24)
- Script parse smoke test passed for `index.html` inline JS (`new Function` parse).
- Ran skill Playwright client:
  - `node tmp_web_game_playwright_client.mjs --url http://127.0.0.1:3000 --actions-file /home/sampire/.codex/skills/develop-web-game/references/action_payloads.json --click-selector "#quote-display" --iterations 2 --pause-ms 250 --screenshot-dir output/web-game-mining`
  - Artifacts: `output/web-game-mining/shot-0.png`, `output/web-game-mining/errors-0.json`.
  - Console artifact contains one existing 404 resource load error in this environment.
- Attempted direct full-page Playwright screenshot for visual confirmation of laser/shatter UI; blocked in this sandbox by Chromium launch failure (`sandbox_host_linux.cc` fatal). The skill client run itself completed successfully.

## Update 25: Mining laser origin ship adjustment
- Changed mining laser origin from viewport-bottom to typing box-bottom anchor.
- Added floating origin ship in mining overlay (`#mining-laser-ship`) using the same community-goals player ship SVG via `getCommunityShipSprite('player')`.
- Laser now computes origin from quote box geometry:
  - `originX` = quote box center
  - `shipBottom` = relative to quote box bottom
  - laser starts near ship nose (`originY = shipBottom + shipHeight - 6`)
- Added ship hover animation (`@keyframes miningShipHover`) and ship styling to align with existing community ship visuals.
- Parse smoke test passed.

## Update 26: Laser/ship targeting refinement
- Moved mining ship origin to bottom-left of typing box (instead of center/bottom-screen behavior).
- Increased quote box vertical space and bottom padding so ship has dedicated clearance beneath text.
- Adjusted Words 30s compact viewport to preserve extra lower clearance.
- Added dynamic ship rotation toward active word (`--ship-angle`) while preserving hover animation.
- Laser origin now uses ship-mounted coordinates and continues to track active word/WPM coloring.
- Re-ran skill Playwright client (`output/web-game-mining-ship-v2`); same existing 404 console resource warning observed.

## Update 27: 16-bit mining explosion style
- Replaced mining word-completion burst from purple cloud-like particles to retro 16-bit style explosion.
- Added blocky pixel shard styling (`.mining-shatter-particle`) with step-based animation and classic explosion palette (yellow/orange/red).
- Added center sprite-like blast (`.mining-shatter-core`) for quick arcade-style pop.
- Updated `emitMiningShatterAtWord()` to emit pixel-color fragments and core flash instead of hue-based nebula particles.
- Parse smoke test passed.
- Re-ran skill Playwright client (`output/web-game-mining-pixel`); same existing 404 console resource warning observed.

## Update 28: Ship right-side origin + word-complete laser SFX
- Copied user-provided audio to project: `Sound Effects/laser.mp3` (from `/home/sampire/Downloads/laser.mp3`).
- Moved mining ship/laser origin from left side to right side of quote box:
  - `originX` now uses `quoteRect.right - 44`.
- Added word-complete SFX trigger in `maybeTriggerMiningShatter()`:
  - Plays `playSound(SFX.laser)` when a correctly typed word boundary is completed.
- Added `laser` entry to `SFX` map: `new Audio('Sound Effects/laser.mp3')`.
- Parse smoke test passed.

## Update 29: Per-keystroke mining laser shots
- Replaced persistent long mining beam with short-lived per-keystroke shots.
- Removed static overlay beam/core markup and styles.
- Added transient shot styles/animation:
  - `.mining-laser-shot`
  - `.mining-laser-shot-core`
  - `@keyframes miningLaserShot`
- Added geometry helpers for ship/target alignment:
  - `getMiningLaserAnchorElement(charIndex)`
  - `getMiningLaserGeometry(anchorEl)`
- Added `emitMiningLaserShotAtWord(typedIndex)` and wired it into key handling so each accepted keypress fires an individual laser at the current typed word.
- Ship remains visible and rotates toward current target; overlay no longer renders one continuous beam.
- Parse smoke test passed.
- Playwright client rerun (`output/web-game-mining-shots`) with same pre-existing 404 resource warning.

## Update 30: Laser shot origin fix + sound refresh
- Overwrote in-project laser SFX with latest user-provided file:
  - copied `/home/sampire/Downloads/laser.mp3` -> `Sound Effects/laser.mp3`.
- Fixed per-keystroke mining shot origin mismatch:
  - Shot CSS now uses `bottom` positioning (not `top`).
  - Shot JS now passes `originYFromBottom` for `--shot-origin-y`.
- This aligns the shot spawn point with the ship-mounted bottom-origin geometry used by the overlay/rotation math.
- Parse smoke test passed.

## Update 31: Mining laser SFX mute toggle
- Added a second compact toggle next to Mining FX: `Laser SFX: On/Muted` (`#mining-fx-sfx-toggle-btn`).
- Toggle visibility is conditional:
  - shown only when `Mining FX` is On
  - hidden when `Mining FX` is Off.
- Added persisted preference key:
  - `sampire-mining-laser-sound-enabled`
  - load/update/toggle functions wired:
    - `loadMiningLaserSoundPreference()`
    - `updateMiningLaserSoundToggleButton()`
    - `toggleMiningLaserSound()`
- Laser audio playback now respects this setting in `maybeTriggerMiningShatter()`.
- Parse smoke test passed.

## Update 32: Sector Map button + full-screen navigation modal
- Added `Sector Map` button to stats header row, right-aligned to the right of `Time`.
- Button visibility is mode-aware: shown in `Random Words` mode (`currentMode === 'words'`), hidden otherwise.
- Added full-screen Sector Map modal (`#sector-map-modal`) with:
  - dark deep-space SVG background
  - pulsing grid overlay (`.sector-grid-pulse`)
  - glowing orb system nodes by difficulty:
    - Easy = blue
    - Medium = purple
    - High stakes = gold
  - dashed constellation links between unlocked nodes only
- Added keyboard-focus + hover tactical overlay (`#sector-tactical-overlay`) showing avg WPM requirement for focused node.
- Added open/close handlers:
  - `openSectorMap()`, `closeSectorMap()`, `handleSectorMapBackdrop()`
  - Esc key closes sector map.
- Parse smoke test passed.
- Playwright client run for regression sanity (`output/web-game-sector-map`), with same existing 404 resource warning.

## Update 33: Sector Map parallax + radar sweep
- Added starfield parallax for Sector Map:
  - Mouse move over `.sector-map-wrap` now translates `#sector-map-stars` subtly for depth.
  - Added reset on mouse leave and close.
- Added rotating radar sweep centered on map:
  - New SVG radar layer (`#sector-map-radar`) with ring + sweep line/cone.
  - Sweep rotation is driven by `requestAnimationFrame` in `animateSectorMapRadar()`.
- Added node pass-highlighting during sweep:
  - Nodes get `.radar-hit` class when sweep angle passes over their angular position.
  - CSS boosts core/halo intensity while hit.
- Added lifecycle controls:
  - `startSectorMapRadar()` on open
  - `stopSectorMapRadar()` on close
  - one-time parallax event binding via `bindSectorMapParallax()`.
- Parse smoke test passed.
- Playwright sanity run (`output/web-game-sector-map-parallax-radar`) completed; same existing 404 resource warning present.

## Update 34: Sector radar removed + map expanded
- Removed Sector Map radar entirely:
  - deleted radar SVG group and sweep assets
  - removed radar CSS classes/animations
  - removed radar JS constants/functions and open/close hooks.
- Expanded Sector Map to fill screen more aggressively:
  - modal card width increased to `min(1400px, 99vw)`
  - modal max height increased to `98vh`
  - map viewport height increased to `min(92vh, 900px)`.
- Parse smoke test passed.

## Update 16: Lyra Gate mission window (Sector Map level 1)
- Added a dedicated centered modal for `Lyra Gate` (`#lyra-gate-modal`) opened from the Sector Map node click.
- Added Lyra mission scene UI above the words:
  - slowly rotating pixel-styled asteroid
  - player ship sprite (same ship style used in community goal visuals)
  - per-correct-keystroke laser burst from ship toward asteroid
- Added Lyra typing loop with isolated state (separate from main typing run):
  - custom hidden input + key handler while Lyra modal is open
  - word stream render with active-word character correctness coloring
- Added asteroid cycle behavior every 30 correctly completed words:
  - asteroid explosion animation
  - pixel explosion particles
  - Aether crystal burst that flies toward the ship
  - ship fly-away animation
  - automatic scene reset for next asteroid
- Added Sector Map node interaction routing:
  - Lyra node opens mission window when accessible
  - locked sectors show a lock message
  - other accessible sectors show “not online yet” message
- Added keyboard support on sector nodes (`Enter`/`Space`) for mission launch.

### Validation
- Inline JS parse smoke test passed (`parse-ok`).
- Ran Playwright skill client against `file://` URL due sandbox port-binding restrictions:
  - command executed successfully
  - one known console error from `file://` Fetch API restrictions on local sound-pack config fetch (expected in file protocol)

### Notes / next agent
- In this sandbox, direct localhost hosting is blocked (`PermissionError` on binding port), so full end-to-end UI automation against `http://127.0.0.1` could not be run here.
- Recommend validating Lyra interaction manually in normal local dev environment:
  1. open Sector Map
  2. click `Lyra Gate`
  3. type 30 correct words and confirm explosion/crystal/ship-reset sequence

## Update 17: Lyra Gate typing parity + hit debris refinement
- Adjusted Lyra typing field to better match the main typing field look/feel:
  - same typography style family and larger type scale
  - darker main-field-like panel styling
  - explicit `overflow-x: hidden` to prevent bottom horizontal scrollbar
- Added per-hit asteroid debris behavior:
  - each correct keystroke laser now triggers 1-2 small rock chunks
  - chunks blast from the asteroid edge and drift/fade off with randomized vectors
- Kept existing behavior:
  - ship remains aimed toward asteroid
  - lasers fire only on correct keystrokes
  - 30-word cycle explosion/crystal collection/ship fly-away reset remains intact

### Validation
- Inline JS parse smoke test passed (`parse-ok`).

## Update 18: Lyra node click hardening
- Added robust Sector Map node activation fallback:
  - `handleSectorSystemSelectById(systemId)` resolver
  - delegated click handler on `#sector-map-nodes`
  - inline `onclick` binding per node group for extra browser resilience
- Added larger invisible hit target circle around each star node to improve clickability.
- Kept existing accessibility keyboard triggers (`Enter`/`Space`).

### Validation
- Inline JS parse smoke test passed (`parse-ok`).

## Update 19: Lyra visual parity fixes (asteroid/laser/typing field)
- Reworked Lyra asteroid from rounded-square into irregular rock silhouette:
  - non-square border-radius profile + polygon clip-path
- Strengthened laser visibility:
  - raised laser/chunk/crystal/explosion layers above scene objects
  - thicker beam, brighter glow, longer visibility window
  - centered beam transform (`translateY(-50%)`) for correct line alignment
- Updated Lyra typing field to match main typing field styling:
  - same panel colors/border style and Ubuntu Mono type styling
  - same base text metrics (font size, line-height, letter-spacing)
  - explicit `overflow-x: hidden` to remove bottom scrollbar
- Updated Lyra character rendering to reuse main typing classes:
  - `char-correct`, `char-incorrect`, `char-untyped`, `char-cursor`
  - gives identical color/cursor behavior as primary typing modes

### Validation
- Inline JS parse smoke test passed (`parse-ok`).

## Update 20: Lyra typing/aim parity pass
- Restored Lyra cursor/error visuals to match main typing behavior:
  - removed Lyra-specific cursor override that hid caret
  - Lyra stream now uses primary `char-*` styling behavior (`char-correct`, `char-incorrect`, `char-untyped`, `char-cursor`)
- Added per-word attempt tracking for completed words in Lyra:
  - completed words now retain correct/incorrect character coloring based on what user typed
- Recalibrated ship aim rotation with sprite orientation offset (`+90deg`) so ship points toward asteroid.
- Ensured aim updates on each Lyra render/keystroke, and lasers continue firing on each correct keystroke.
- Brought Lyra typing panel spacing/typography closer to main quote field metrics.

### Validation
- Inline JS parse smoke test passed (`parse-ok`).

## Update 21: Lyra switched to exact `.quote-display` + shared hidden input (1:1 typing path)
- Replaced Lyra custom text container with real `.quote-display`:
  - new element: `#lyra-quote-display` with classes `quote-display lyra-quote-display`
- Removed Lyra-specific hidden input entirely; Lyra now reuses the main `#hidden-input` typing path.
- Added `focusLyraInput()` and updated modal pointer/focus routing so Lyra typing always targets shared hidden input.
- Updated hidden input focus/blur handlers to toggle `.focused` state between main quote display and Lyra quote display.
- Fixed a runtime Lyra bug in scene reset (`chunks` was referenced before declaration).

### Validation
- Inline JS parse smoke test passed (`parse-ok`).

## Update 22: Lyra hotkey isolation + laser path correction
- Fixed background test reset while Lyra is open:
  - global document key handler now suppresses typing-test hotkeys (`space`, typing intent keys) when Lyra modal is active.
  - prevents main-mode `newTest()/restart()` from firing behind Lyra.
- Corrected Lyra laser geometry to originate from ship muzzle and terminate at asteroid surface:
  - anchors now compute ship center/radius and asteroid center/radius.
  - beam start/end points are projected along the direction vector (ship edge -> asteroid edge).
- Updated ship aim math to use center-to-center vector with sprite angle offset.

### Validation
- Inline JS parse smoke test passed (`parse-ok`).

## Update 23: Lyra laser muzzle anchor + typed/untyped state restoration
- Laser origin fix:
  - added `#lyra-ship-muzzle` anchor element inside rotating ship
  - Lyra anchor math now reads muzzle rect each frame and starts beam exactly at muzzle point
  - beam still terminates at asteroid edge projection
- Typing differentiation fix:
  - removed Lyra-specific color overrides that were overriding the main `char-*` classes
  - restored visible differentiation for `char-correct`, `char-incorrect`, and `char-untyped`

### Validation
- Inline JS parse smoke test passed (`parse-ok`).

## Update 24: Lyra lasers now use exact normal-mode shot renderer
- Added `emitMiningLaserShotCustom(...)` that reuses the normal mining laser visual pipeline:
  - same classes: `.mining-laser-shot` and `.mining-laser-shot-core`
  - same hue/width scaling and animation behavior as normal typing tests
  - same overlay/ship element: `#mining-laser-overlay` / `.mining-laser-ship`
- Rewired `emitLyraLaserBurst()` to compute origin/impact on Lyra ship/asteroid, then call `emitMiningLaserShotCustom(...)`.
- Result: Lyra now mirrors normal laser behavior 1:1, with target swapped from active word to asteroid.

### Validation
- Inline JS parse smoke test passed (`parse-ok`).

## Update 25: Guest rough-location capture + leaderboard display
- Added guest location cache in `localStorage`:
  - key: `sampire-guest-location-cache`
  - payload: `{ city, country, updatedAt }`
  - TTL: 7 days
- Added guest location resolver (`resolveGuestLocation`) that fetches rough IP-based location via `https://ipapi.co/json/` and caches it.
- Guest leaderboard submissions now store `city` and `country` fields with each guest score row.
- Guest leaderboard display name now formats as:
  - `Guest from City, Country` (or best available fallback)
- Local leaderboard API mapping now returns `userId`, `city`, and `country` so rendering can format guest rows.
- Disabled profile tooltip hover fetch for guest rows (no account summary for guests).
- Boot now triggers background guest location resolution for non-logged-in users.

### Validation
- Inline JS parse smoke test passed (`parse-ok`).

## Update 9: Lyra mining FX parity + laser SFX timing
- Sector map Lyra mode now mirrors main-mode word completion burst visuals:
  - Added `emitLyraWordCompletionShatter()` using the same `mining-shatter-core` and `mining-shatter-particle` effect profile.
  - Triggered on perfect word completion (spacebar when typed word exactly matches target).
- Adjusted Lyra laser audio timing:
  - Removed `playSound(SFX.laser)` from per-keystroke `emitLyraLaserBurst()` path.
  - Laser SFX now plays only on perfect word completion and respects `miningLaserSoundEnabled`.

## Update 10: Sector map viewport fit
- Updated `#sector-map-modal .leaderboard-modal-card` to a flex column with hidden overflow so the map uses available modal space instead of forcing inner scrolling.
- Changed `.sector-map-wrap` from fixed `92vh` height to flexible fill (`flex:1`, `height:auto`) with minimum heights.
- Added small-height media query to tighten modal/banner padding and keep the full map visible on shorter screens.

## Update 11: Entry splash + rebrand to TypeMine Galactic
- Added a full-screen pre-entry splash overlay (`#entry-splash`) that appears before the main page UI.
- Splash includes three actions:
  - `Login` -> opens existing login modal
  - `Create New Account` -> opens existing signup modal
  - `Continue as Guest` -> dismisses splash and enters main page
- Added splash lock behavior so gameplay typing input is blocked while splash is open.
- On successful login/signup, splash is auto-dismissed.
- Renamed visible app name in primary surfaces:
  - `index.html` `<title>` and `h1` now `TypeMine Galactic`
  - `apple-mobile-web-app-title` now `TypeMine Galactic`
  - `manifest.webmanifest` `name`/`short_name` now `TypeMine Galactic` / `TypeMine`
- Added logo image slot on splash (`typemine-galactic-logo.png`) with a built-in fallback emblem if the file is not present.

## Update 12: Splash UI restyle toward reference look
- Restyled entry splash to a cleaner cinematic/start-screen look closer to the provided reference:
  - Larger centered logo.
  - Added moving shine sweep over logo.
  - Neon rectangular `LOGIN` and `SIGN UP` buttons.
  - `CONTINUE AS GUEST` converted to subtle underlined text button.
  - Added bottom metadata strip (`Build`, `Version`, copyright).
  - Added centered prompt text: `Press any key to start`.
- Behavior update: while splash is open, pressing a start key now continues as guest and dismisses splash.

## Update 13: Splash pulse + sector-style starfield
- Added a slow pulsing animation to the splash prompt text (`Press any key to start`).
- Added splash star background layer (`#entry-splash-stars`) using the same randomized generation logic/colors/twinkle behavior as sector map stars.
- Kept grid disabled on splash (stars only), per request.

## Update 14: Splash logo style adjustment
- Re-copied splash logo asset from `/home/sampire/Downloads/typemine logo.png` to project logo path (`typemine-galactic-logo.png`).
- Updated splash logo presentation:
  - Removed shine sweep animation.
  - Increased logo display size substantially.
  - Added slow hover animation (`splashLogoHover`) so logo gently floats.

## Update 15: Hide main UI behind splash
- Added `body.splash-active` state to hide the visible main game interface while splash is open.
- Main typing/test UI (top bar, title, tabs, container and overlays) is now hidden and non-interactive until splash is dismissed.
- `initializeEntrySplash()` now adds `splash-active`; `hideSplashScreen()` removes it.

## Update 16: Two-step splash interaction + larger logo
- Splash now starts in `phase-intro`:
  - Only `Press any key to start` is visible.
  - Login/Sign Up/Guest/meta are hidden.
- First key press now transitions splash to `phase-options`:
  - Prompt fades out.
  - Login/Sign Up/Guest/meta fade in.
- Removed prior behavior where first key auto-continued as guest.
- Increased splash logo size again for stronger visual emphasis.

## Update 17: Larger splash logo + restored footer meta
- Increased splash logo render size significantly (upscaled to near full-screen cap).
- Restored splash footer metadata visibility (Build / Version / Copyright now visible in intro phase and options phase).

## Update 18: Splash fit fix after oversized logo
- Reduced extreme logo scaling to a large-but-contained responsive size so splash content fits on screen again.
- Added mobile-specific logo size caps to prevent overflow on smaller viewports.
- Slightly reduced splash card min-height cap to improve vertical fit.

## Update 19: Splash layout rebalance (large logo + fit-safe spacing)
- Reworked splash card to a vertical flex layout with `space-between` for consistent centering and spacing.
- Increased logo size significantly, but constrained with responsive `vw` + `vh` caps so it fits on screen.
- Reduced splash padding on shorter screens and tuned mobile logo caps to prevent overflow.
- Centered and wrapped footer metadata for cleaner alignment across widths.

## Update 20: Splash prompt/options replacement + Escape return behavior
- Changed splash center interaction area to a shared stage (`entry-splash-stage`) so prompt and auth options occupy the same position.
- Updated prompt copy to: `Press any key to continue`.
- First key press now fades prompt out and fades options in at the exact same slot (not underneath).
- `Escape` while splash is active now:
  - closes login/signup modals
  - returns splash from options phase back to intro prompt phase.
- Nudged stage upward (closer to logo) for tighter vertical composition.

## Update 21: Main game header logo swap
- Replaced the main game title text (`TypeMine Galactic`) with the logo image in the primary header area.
- Added a fallback text title that appears only if the logo image fails to load.
- Added dedicated main-title logo sizing/style to keep the header centered and clean.

## Update 22: Logo asset crop + larger in-game header logo
- Reprocessed `typemine-galactic-logo.png` to a tighter, transparent crop around the logo text/glow so scaling uses the visible mark instead of large empty margins.
- Increased main game header logo max-height to improve perceived size at full container width.

## Update 23: Splash logo size correction
- Reduced splash/login logo scaling to fit cleanly in the login screen.
- Kept the larger in-game header logo unchanged.
- Adjusted both desktop and mobile splash logo caps.

## Update 24: Resolution-aware splash scaling
- Reworked splash/login layout sizing to scale with browser resolution using `clamp()` and viewport-based dimensions.
- Main splash logo now shrinks with window size while preserving spacing between prompt, auth buttons, guest link, and footer meta.
- Confirmed `index.html` scripts still parse successfully after the responsive layout changes.

## Update 25: Splash auth sounds + cached-session continue label
- Added splash/login sound cues:
  - `Ding.wav` now plays when the user selects `Login`, `Sign Up`, or `Continue as Guest` on the splash.
  - `Logon.wav` now plays when the user successfully logs in, successfully creates an account, or continues as a guest.
- Updated splash primary button behavior for cached sessions:
  - If `currentUser` is already restored, the splash login button now says `Continue as <user>`.
  - Clicking it bypasses the login modal and continues straight into the app.
- Fixed splash auth audio routing so `Ding.wav` only plays when opening Login/Sign Up from the splash, while cached-session continue and guest continue now play only `Logon.wav`.
- Centered the `Words 30s` text vertically inside its compact quote box on desktop and mobile.
- Added a sector-map-specific entrance sequence so the story-mode map now blooms in with a backdrop flare, card rise, starfield wake, route/node stagger, and UI reveal instead of appearing instantly.
- Added shared menu entrance animations across `leaderboard-modal` and `profile-modal` screens, so login/profile/shop/inventory/challenges-related menus now open with the same backdrop bloom, card rise, and content fade-up instead of snapping in.
- Removed the shared modal lens-flare bloom layer so menu openings keep the motion but no longer show the out-of-place flare behind the panels.
- Restyled the story-mode button into `Galactic Progression` with a neon purple/deep-blue gradient, pulsing console glow, hover scale-up, and star icon so it reads as the primary premium entry point without affecting the adjacent `Share` button.
